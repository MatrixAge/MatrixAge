## Wendao

I'm the founder of [Matrixages](http://matrixages.com/) ,also i am a web developer and designer,above is my work title,I prefer to identify myself as a product maker,you can call me wendao.My goal is to pursue beauty, think about the relationship between man and nature, explore the design system formed by nature, and apply it to life and product design.

I love to appreciate all kinds of architecture and get inspiration from it. I have a concept that everything can be designed. If you look at the world again with the idea of design, you will find many amazing things.

## Sprites

I have a lot of research on ancient Chinese culture, such as Tao Te Ching, Shan Hai Jing, the book of songs, Chu Ci and so on. These ancient books give me a lot of inspiration on how to be a man and how to design games.I like a sentence in Tao Te Ching, which is also a famous saying of Bruce Lee: Be Water.
