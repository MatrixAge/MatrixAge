## Wendao

A web developer, designer and a product maker, founder of [Matrixages](http://matrixages.com/), you can call me wendao. My goal is to pursue the ultimate beauty, think about the relationship between man and nature, explore the design system formed by nature, and apply it to life and product design.

I love to appreciate all kinds of architecture and get inspiration from it. I have a concept that everything can be designed.

## Sprites

I have a lot of research on ancient Chinese culture, such as Tao Te Ching, Shan Hai Jing, and so on. These ancient books give me a lot of inspiration on how to be a man, how to create and how to design. I like a sentence in Tao Te Ching, which is also a famous saying of Bruce Lee:

Be Water.
